# HelpWise AI – Context-Aware Memory

HelpWise AI has a context-aware memory system that allows it to remember and refer to previous interactions in a conversation. This improves the chatbot's ability to handle complex queries and provide more personalized responses.

## 1. Memory Features

### a. Conversation History
- **Feature:** The chatbot retains the history of user interactions within a session.
- **Purpose:** Enables the chatbot to refer back to previous queries, providing more relevant and accurate answers. For example, if a user asks about a product and later asks for pricing, the chatbot can reference the product discussed earlier.

### b. Contextual Understanding
- **Feature:** The chatbot can remember key details from earlier interactions (e.g., user preferences, product details).
- **Purpose:** Helps the chatbot provide context-aware responses that feel more natural and coherent over time.

### c. Session Persistence
- **Feature:** If a user closes and reopens the chat interface, the chatbot can maintain session persistence (with user consent).
- **Purpose:** Ensures users don’t need to start a new conversation every time they return, enhancing the overall user experience.

## 2. Benefits of Context-Aware Memory

- **Personalized Support:** HelpWise AI tailors its responses based on the user's previous interactions, making the experience more engaging.
- **Reduced Repetition:** Users don’t need to repeat themselves, as the chatbot remembers prior conversations.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Context-aware responses allow users to get quicker, more relevant answers without having to explain their situation repeatedly.

## 3. Data Retention and Deletion
- **Feature:** Contextual memory can be cleared or reset by the user at any time.
- **Purpose:** Users can maintain control over their data and decide if they want the chatbot to forget previous interactions.

## 4. Use Cases for Context Memory
- **Example 1:** A user asks for help with a product and later inquires about a different feature of the same product. The chatbot recalls the earlier context to provide a more relevant answer.
- **Example 2:** A user asks for a troubleshooting solution and the chatbot remembers the issue they previously reported, ensuring a smoother follow-up conversation.
